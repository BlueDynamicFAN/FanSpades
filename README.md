## Spades
  * To build and run
    - Build in x64 release mode for the project and x86 release for the server
    - Run in debug mode for the server and client, and run the other client from the file explorer
    - (This probably a weird thing to do, but sometimes the second client doesn't connect properly)
    - Keep rerunning until the second client works
  * Controls
    - Press left and right keys to move the card selector
    - Press space to play the card
